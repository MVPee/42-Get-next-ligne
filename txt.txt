As egocentric as Sheldon has been lately, there was bound to be something that set Leonard off one of these days.
I suppose an argument over Harry Potter spoilers is as valid as anything else.
And certainly, anyone who struggled to power-read the final couple of books before spoilers hit the grapevine can sympathize.
It was an amusing way to kick off what was a relatively dark episode by Big Bang standards.
However, I thought the writers were a little cruel when they mirrored the conflict at the end by having Sheldon spoil a major character death in The Walking Dead.
Harry Potter spoilers are fair game at this point. The final book is well over five years old and the movie adaptations have come and gone.
But to spoil a major development in a TV season that isn't even finished yet, much less available on DVD, is just cruel and thoughtless on the part of the writers.
